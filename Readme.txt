== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why another Twitter plugins =

Because I didn't find something enought simple and easy to add to my theme. I've decided to write my own one... as usual. 

= How much the plugins' cost ? =

It's as you whish. That's a donationware. So If you want to give only 1$
or event nothing you can. But don't impose any limits on yourself, if you
want to give me a lot of money, just do it ;)

= What are the limitation of the free version =

There's no free version so there's no limitation. Perhaps I'll change that 
in the future. But for the moment, I can't maintain seriously this plugins. But 
if you like the plugins and think I deserver to be paid for it, you have a
donate button on the plugin's mainpage.
